                        The corona pandemic is hitting our African businesses way 
                        harder than any other challenge in the previous decade, for 
                        the fact that most businesses/ organizations hadnâ€™t embraced 
                        running online and they depend on foot traffic or daily physical 
                        sales. This is pushing business leaders to rethink their current 
                        business models to adapt to current conditions. SMEs in particular are 
                        faced with the challenge of maintaining existing supply chains, preventing 
                        an explosion in costs, dealing with falling demand, COVID-19 restrictions and at 
                        the same time facing enormous uncertainty.

                        On the other hand there are some creative entrepreneurs

                        providing products and services amidst the crisis.
